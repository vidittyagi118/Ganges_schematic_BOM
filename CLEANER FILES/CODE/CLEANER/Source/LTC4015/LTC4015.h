LTC4015: Multichemistry Buck Battery Charger Controller with Digital Telemetry System

@verbatim
The  LTC®4015  is  a  complete  synchronous  buck  controller/charger  with pin
selectable,  chemistry specific charging and termination algorithms. The LTC4015
can  charge  Li-Ion/Polymer,  LiFePO4,  or  leadacid  batteries.  Battery charge
voltage  is  pin  selectable and I²C adjustable. Input current limit and charge
current   can   be  accurately  programmed  with  sense  resistors  and  can  be
individually  adjusted  via  the  I²C  serial  port. A digital telemetry system
monitors  all  system  power  parameters.  Safety  timer and current termination
algorithms  are  supported  for  lithium  chemistry  batteries. The LTC4015 also
includes  automatic  recharge, precharge (Li-Ion) and NTC thermistor protection.
The LTC4015's I²C port allows user customization of charger algorithms, reading
of  charger  status  information, configuration of the maskable and programmable
alerts,  plus  use  and  configuration  of  the  Coulomb counter. Available in a
38-Lead 5mm × 7mm QFN package.

/*! @file
 *  @ingroup LTC4015
 *  @brief LTC4015 communication library core header file defining
 *  prototypes, data structures and constants used by LTC4015.c
 *
 *  Functions  matching  the  prototypes  of  @ref  smbus_write_register and @ref
 *  smbus_read_register  must  be  provided  to this API. They will implement the
 *  SMBus  read  and write transactions on your hardware. If the register size of
 *  the  LTC4015  is 8 bits, functions should be provided that implement SMBus
 *  read  byte and write byte. If the register size of the LTC4015 is 16 bits,
 *  functions  should  be provided that implement SMBus read word and write word.
 *  smbus_read_register  needs  to  store the value read from the LTC4015 into
 *  the  variable  data.  Both  functions  should return 0 on success and a non-0
 *  error  code  on  failure.  The  API functions will return your error codes on
 *  failure and a 0 on success.

    The LTC4015_init requires some memory for each LTC4015. This memory can
    be  statically  allocated  by  defining  MAX_NUM_LTC4015_INSTANCES  to the
    number of LTC4015s required. Alternatively it can be dynamically allocated
    by  defining  LTC4015_USE_MALLOC.  The  default  is  to not use malloc and
    statically allocate one LTC4015.
